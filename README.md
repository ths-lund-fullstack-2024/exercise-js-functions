## Intro

**Why learning functions in JavaScript is vital for your progress within in programming and development**

Imagine you’re a chef in a bustling kitchen. Every day, you whip up delicious meals, but instead of reinventing the wheel with each dish, you have a secret weapon: recipes! Recipes allow you to create the same wonderful dishes over and over again, saving time and ensuring quality. This is exactly what functions do in programming.

### 1. **Efficiency and Reusability**

Functions allow you to write a piece of code once and use it multiple times without having to rewrite it. This is not only efficient but also helps reduce errors. Just like a recipe ensures you don’t forget an ingredient, functions help you maintain consistent results in your code. If you need to change something, you only need to update it in one place!

### 2. **Organization and Clarity**

Functions help organize your code into manageable pieces. Instead of a long, convoluted script, you can break your program into logical sections. This makes your code easier to read, understand, and maintain. Think of it as dividing a big project into smaller, more manageable tasks. Each function handles a specific job, making it clearer what your program does.

### 3. **Problem-Solving Skills**

Programming is essentially about problem-solving. Functions teach you how to break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts. By practicing creating functions, you develop critical thinking skills that are essential not only in programming but in everyday life. You’ll learn how to approach challenges methodically, think creatively, and find effective solutions.

### 4. **Collaboration and Teamwork**

In the programming world, collaboration is key. When you work on larger projects with others, functions help different team members understand how parts of the system interact. You can build functions that can be shared and reused by others, making teamwork more effective and enjoyable.

### 5. **Foundational Knowledge for Advanced Topics**

Functions are a building block for more advanced programming concepts, such as object-oriented programming, asynchronous programming, and frameworks. Understanding functions sets you up for success as you explore more complex topics and technologies in the future.

### Conclusion

Learning to create and work with functions in JavaScript isn’t just a skill; it’s an essential part of becoming a competent programmer. It empowers you to write cleaner code, enhances your problem-solving abilities, and prepares you for more complex programming challenges. So, embrace the journey of learning functions, and watch as your coding skills—and confidence—grow!

## Exercises

Down below is 15 questions on an easy level and 14 on a more intermediate level. When you try and solve these one, remember to use everything you have learned so far. You will need to use arrays, array methods, loops, maths and other stuff as well. Give them a shot, don't just chatgpt them. Work together with a friend if you find them hard.
